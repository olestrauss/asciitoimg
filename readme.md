# Tool to convert images to ASCII art, and then convert that ASCII art to an image

Uses [ascii_magic](https://github.com/LeandroBarone/python-ascii_magic) and [DALLE](https://openai.com/).

Nothing more than a tool to create some interesting images, with some resemblance to the original.

A lot of detail is sacrificed due to resizing and DALLE prompt character limitations.
