# Tool to convert images to ASCII art, and then convert that ASCII art to an image

Uses (https://github.com/LeandroBarone/python-ascii_magic)[ascii_magic] and (https://openai.com/)[DALLE].

Nothing more than a tool to create some interesting images, with some resemblance to the original.

A lot of detail is sacrificed due to resizing and DALLE prompt character limitations.
